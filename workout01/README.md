I am here to provide a short introduction of the workout content.

This homework is about to use the shots data download from the course website inside the data file to perform an analysis concerning the shoting performance of five Golden Warriors players. The code used will be included in the code file, and such analysis will generate some images(both pdf and png format) in the image file, some summary data in output file and final report in report file.

Concerning the report, as I am completely new to basketball reports, I finded it hard to give detailed description unless I just copied from somewhere-I guess you will not be happy to see that, as the learning curve of reporting is steep, I will try to learn more during the future analysis. So please forgive me not to give a longer report in this time between several midterms.
